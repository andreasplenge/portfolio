  description: Engineer with experience in stabilizing the energy grid. I combine a hybrid background in mathematics and software engineering to design scalable analytical tools and model complex systems. I have a strong foundation in dynamical systems, probability, and programming, and I am motivated by solving data-driven problems in performance-sensitive environments, particularly those involving uncertainty, forecasting, and optimization.
