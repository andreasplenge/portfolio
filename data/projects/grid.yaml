  description: The system is a real-time, multi-device energy control platform designed to manage distributed heating and energy assets efficiently. It aggregates heterogeneous devices ranging from 1 kW to 50 kW into pools of up to 500 kW, maintaining precise capacity targets within ±5% / +15% in under 3 seconds.

  introduction: |
    Device Aggregation and Allocation
    Device normalization: Heterogeneous devices are grouped and scaled to enable fair comparison and allocation.

    Optimal selection: For each target setpoint, the system calculates the optimal combination of devices to meet the desired aggregate capacity.

    Constraints management:
    Device cycling is minimized to prevent wear.
    Activation times and historical usage are tracked for prioritization.
    Normal device operations and safety limits are always respected.
    Micro-device aggregation: Very small devices are pooled to contribute meaningfully to the total capacity.

    Real-Time Control
    Rapid response: Target capacities from 0 to 500 kW are achieved within 2–3 seconds.
    Dynamic reallocation: Devices are continuously reselected based on availability, state, and operational constraints to maintain stable aggregate output.
    Distributed execution: Each device executes its allocated contribution via local controllers while adhering to physical and operational constraints.

    Integration
    IoT Device Integration:
    Integrated with Shelly devices and thermostats of water heaters.
    Thermostat control is bypassed safely, preserving overcooking relays and normal operation.
    Hardware Control:
    Designed custom electrical boards for controlling buffer tanks in heat pumps, ensuring reliable operation while respecting safety constraints.

    Business Logic
    Full ecosystem mapping:
    Installer → Contract → Device → Customer → Address → Rewards.
    Ensures that operational performance ties directly to installer incentives and contract fulfillment.
    Reward calculation: Tracks device contributions in real-time to properly allocate financial rewards and operational credits.
