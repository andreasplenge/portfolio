  description: Accurate image segmentation is essential for applications such as self-driving cars.

  introduction: |
    Accurate image segmentation is essential for applications such as self-driving cars. This project explores and compares two segmentation architectures using the CamVid dataset, which contains driving scenes captured from a vehicle's perspective. We evaluate a traditional CNN-based encoder–decoder model, SegNet, and a newer vision transformer–based model, SegFormer. SegNet is trained from scratch, while SegFormer is fine-tuned under different settings to analyze their impact on performance. Additionally, we compare our results with a SegFormer model trained on the Cityscapes dataset, using a relabeling scheme to align its classes with CamVid.
